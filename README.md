# Advanced Synthetic Network Analysis (One-folder)
This project captures live packets from a private network, performs advanced feature engineering, runs a hybrid AI detection pipeline (Isolation Forest + LSTM Autoencoder + ensemble logic), enriches detections with VirusTotal IP reputation, and shows results in a Streamlit SOC-style dashboard.

## Setup
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
